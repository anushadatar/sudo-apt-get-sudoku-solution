# sudo apt-get sudoku-solution
A python sudoku solver as an investigation of graph coloring algorithms for Olin College Discrete Mathematics FA19 Homework 5 by Diego Berny, Jordan Crawford-O'Banner, and Anusha Datar.


Suggested informaiton from homework to include is
- Look at the Wikipedia article on Graph Coloring for some details of related words but Google for better resources (this Wikipedia article is not as good as the ones above).
- Find the chromatic number for some families of graphs (e.g. complete graphs, cycles, wheels, paths).
- Learn what chromatic polynomials are, and find them for some families of graphs (e.g. complete graphs, cycles, wheels, paths).
- Implement one or more coloring algorithms/heuristics
- Learn about NP and its connections to coloring
- Explain the Four Color Theorem and its controversial history
- Illustrate some of the applications of coloring through graph modeling.
- Explore variations of colorings, such as edge colorings and L(2,1)-colorings; read about them, do examples for various families of graphs, describe their applications.
- Follow your own interests to explore graph colorings in a different way.
