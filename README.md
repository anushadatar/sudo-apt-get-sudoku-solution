# Graph Coloring
The **coloring** of a simple graph refers the configuration where each vertex of the graph is assigned a color such that no two adjacent vertices are given the same color. For most graphs, a coloring of interest has the lowest possible number of unique colors. This minimum quantity of colors is called the **chromatic number** of the graph. While graph coloring problems often consider the vertices of a simple graph, the same principles extend to problems such as coloring the regions of a planar graph such that no set of adjacent regions match.

The **four color theorem** asserts that for any planar graph (a graph where no edge crosses another edge), the chromatic number of that planar graph is no greater than four. While this theorem was proposed as a conjecture in the 1850s, it was not formally proven until 1976. Prior to that, there were both fallacious proofs that were accepted (and then later rejected) and adoption of approximations like the Five Color Theorem. The actual four color theorem was proven in 1979 using a computer program that eliminated each possible type of counterexample. This proof was one of the first major computer-aided proofs.
