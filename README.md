# Graph Coloring
- general intro about graph coloring, basically just following the bullet point of "Look at the Wikipedia article on Graph Coloring for some details of related words but Google for better resources (this Wikipedia article is not as good as the ones above)."
- probably nice to talk about the four color theorem and chromatic number if only generally

# The Sudoku Graph
- general explanation of the sudoku graph and maybe an image

# Graph Coloring for Sudoku
## Implementation
- general explanation of algorithm + connections to graph theory

## Evaluation
- runtime, discussion about NP as said in bullet points
